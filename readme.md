# TEAMIT BLOG TEST

Hello! This is my [Team.it](https://team-it.pt/#teamit) blog test.

How to use:

Yarn api to start the JSON SERVER api

Yarn dev to start the code

Yarn test to run all tests

in this test, i cover some points like:

- Architeture organization
- Semantic code
- SSG Strategy
- Styled Component
- Commit Organization
- Services structure
- Unit Tests
- React Hook Form + Validations

P.S: Please keep mind i'm also have knowleges in Hooks, like useEffect, useState, etc. And i'm also know create my custom Hooks.

But for this project, I don't needed to use most of them.

Hope you enjoy it!!
